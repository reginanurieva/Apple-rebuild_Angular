#### Rebuild of apple.com using Angular.

#### By _Regina Nurieva, 10.26.2018_

## Description

Application that rebuilds apple.com using Angular. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Specs week I

1. Separate application into components.

2. Create basic structure of application.


## Specs week II

1. Add routing to the application.

2. Create components for each new route (current version of the application contains two routes: TV and iPad).

3. Deploy the app into Firebase(the current stage of an application doesn't contain a database, application is hosted under the link 'https://apple-rebuild.firebaseapp.com/')

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
